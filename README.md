# This Repo is to help me document my Revision for Quality Gates

I need to be able to Recall information when asked, therefore good practice is to create a centralised location where information, answers and techniques for responses such as **STAR** are documented.

### STAR-Responses

This section will follow the pattern of **Question** : **Answer**. **STAR :star:** stands for **Situation**, **Task**, **Action** and **Result** and is an extremely useful way of answering a question in an interview. It is a good way to show the employer how you have used, implemented and benefited from a particular tool or software.

**Situation (S)**: Describe the situation that you were in or the task that you needed to accomplish. You must describe a specific event or situation, not a generalized description of what you have done in the past. Be sure to give enough detail for the interviewer to understand. This situation can be from a previous job, from a volunteer experience, or any relevant event.

**Task (T)**: What goal were you working toward? 

**Action (A)**: Describe the actions you took to address the situation with an appropriate amount of detail and keep the focus on **YOU**. What specific steps did you take and what was your particular contribution? Be careful that you don’t describe what the team or group did when talking about a project, but what you actually did. Use the word “I,” not “we” when describing actions.

**Result (R)**: Describe the outcome of your actions and don’t be shy about taking credit for your behavior. What happened? How did the event end? What did you accomplish? What did you learn? Make sure your answer contains multiple positive results.

#### Question 1

* **Q** : What is DevOps? 

* **A** : DevOps is of growing importance in the IT industry, it is an approach that aims to synergise the efforts of the development and operations teams to accelerate the delivery of software products, with a minimal failure rate. DevOps Engineers focus on value-added practice, where development and operations engineers join hands throughout the product or service lifecycle, right from the design stage to the point of development. <br>
Devops requires a cultural shift that merges operations with development and demands a linked toolchain of technologies to facilitate collaborative change. Since the DevOps philosphy is at a very nascent stage, application of DevOps as well as the bandwidth required to adapt and collaborate, varies from organisation to organisation. A portfolio of DevOps skills is a very valueable as it shows tools you are familiar with which ould be perfect for an organisation already implementing that toolchain.
