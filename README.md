# This Repo is to help me document my Revision for Quality Gates

I need to be able to Recall information when asked, therefore good practice is to create a centralised location where information, answers and techniques for responses such as **STAR** are documented.

### STAR-Responses

This section will follow the pattern of **Question** : **Answer**. **STAR :star:** stands for **Situation**, **Task**, **Action** and **Result** and is an extremely useful way of answering a question in an interview. It is a good way to show the employer how you have used, implemented and benefited from a particular tool or software.

**Situation üìã (S)**: Describe the situation that you were in or the task that you needed to accomplish. You must describe a specific event or situation, not a generalized description of what you have done in the past. Be sure to give enough detail for the interviewer to understand. This situation can be from a previous job, from a volunteer experience, or any relevant event.

**Task üìå (T)**: What goal were you working toward? 

**Action üëî (A)**: Describe the actions you took to address the situation with an appropriate amount of detail and keep the focus on **YOU**. What specific steps did you take and what was your particular contribution? Be careful that you don‚Äôt describe what the team or group did when talking about a project, but what you actually did. Use the word ‚ÄúI,‚Äù not ‚Äúwe‚Äù when describing actions.

**Result üí° (R)**: Describe the outcome of your actions and don‚Äôt be shy about taking credit for your behavior. What happened? How did the event end? What did you accomplish? What did you learn? Make sure your answer contains multiple positive results.

#### Question 1

* **Q** : What is DevOps? 

* **A** : DevOps is of growing importance in the IT industry, it is an approach that aims to synergise the efforts of the development and operations teams to accelerate the delivery of software products, with a minimal failure rate. DevOps Engineers focus on value-added practice, where development and operations engineers join hands throughout the product or service lifecycle, right from the design stage to the point of development. <br>
Devops requires a cultural shift that merges operations with development and demands a linked toolchain of technologies to facilitate collaborative change. Since the DevOps philosphy is at a very nascent stage, application of DevOps as well as the bandwidth required to adapt and collaborate, varies from organisation to organisation. A portfolio of DevOps skills is a very valueable as it shows tools you are familiar with which ould be perfect for an organisation already implementing that toolchain.

**üìã S** : DevOps is a cultural shift that merges operations with development and demands a collaborative and linked toolchain of technologies to facilitate the change that it brings. During my time at SpartaGlobal we have followed the DevOps process from end to end, The team planned in `Trello` whilst keeping constant communication over `Microsoft teams`, we sent our code to `GitHub` which allowed continuous integration with `Jenkins` finally implementing it on our `deployed` test environment inside `AWS` which when passed was `deployed` to an identical production environment also hosted on `AWS`

**üìå T** : I recieved a webpage designed using `Node`, our aim was to integrate it into a DevOps environment pipeline.

**üëî  A** : To create this pipeline known as the **CICD** pipeline incorporating **Continous Integration** and **Continuous Delivery/ Deployment** I first has to connect our GitHub Repository to Jenkins which would automate the process of taking our code, running it through tests in a test environment, and finally take the code integrate it into a final version inside `GitHub` and then deploy it into our production environment. All the environments are standardised to eleminate the potential for technology issues, for example we used **Ubuntu 16.04** and the same version of our technologies, for example **NodeJS 12.0** and **MongoDB 2.3.0**

**üí° R** : This really points out the importance of the DevOps lifecycle, this toolchain helps us as a DevOp automate, test and standerdize the process of developing a software end to end. As a result of this automation I was able to garuntee that the code I push to GitHub is properly tested inside a test environment before ever reaching the point of deployment eliminating the common issue of human error. The ability to integrate code as it is pushed to GitHub totally eliminates the time consuming process of integrating code from multiple contributors at the end of the day.

#### Question 2

* **Q** : How is DevOps different from agile methodology? 

* **A** : DevOps is a culture that allows the development and the operations teams to work together. This results in continuous development, testing, integration, and monitoring of the software throughout the lifecycle. <br>
Where as Agile is a software development methodology that focuses on iterative, incremental, small, and rapid releases of software, along with customer feedback. It addresses gaps and conflicts between the customers and developers.

**üìã S** : At SpartaGlobal whilst training to become a DevOps I learnt that DevOps is a culture that allows the development and operations teams to work together, it results in the continous development, testing, integration, and minitoring of the software throughout a software lifecycle. We also used a Kanban board on Trello to plan and track the needs of customers in techniques like the STARFISH, Information Radiators and user-stories. Agile focuses on software development as a methodology in which an iterative, incremental, small and rapid releases of software take place along with customer feedback.

**üìå T** : In the Academy I was given the task to change the front page of a web application.

**üëî A** : To achieve this I set up a continous integration and delivery pipeline which was triggered every time I pushed code to my GitHub Repository. After about 20 seconds of me pushing the code the web page which was live on AWS has the new code deployed into it using the SSH protocol. Using the Kanban board and its agile initative I was able to create the CICD pipeline using the product backlog which allowed me to plan the development of the pipelines setup into weekly sprints. 

**üí° R** : As a result the pipeline was created in a single day, and included every necessary step that was required. The guidance of develop was based on the requirements specified inside the kanban board, this allowed me to stay more on track with what was needed at each stage of development. I was also able to design the pipeline in a way that was appropriate and satisfied the expectations of the tests which were run when it was being testing in the continous integration step. DevOps adds a seamless way to automate the software development process and Agile is a methodology to help track, structure and iterate the development that is happening whilst also thinking about what the customers need in the software.
